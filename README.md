### Crescendo - Music Player Application

Crescendo is a versatile music player application that offers two distinct modes for your music enjoyment:

1. **Common Songs Mode**:
   - Browse and play from a list of common songs displayed on the home screen.
   - Enjoy a rich music experience with an interactive card view showcasing the currently playing song.
   - Control your music playback with options to skip forward (+5 seconds), skip backward (-5 seconds), play, and pause.
   - Visualize your music progress with a dynamic song progress bar.

2. **Local Music Mode**:
   - Select and play music files stored on your device's storage.
   - Experience the same set of music controls for a seamless playback experience.
   - The currently playing music is elegantly displayed in a card view.

Additionally, you can easily connect with the developer by clicking the "Meet the Developer" option located in the top-right corner. This option redirects you to the developer's portfolio website at [Utkarsh Mishra's Portfolio](https://utkarsh140503.github.io/Portfolio/).
